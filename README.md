# Ebb-and-Flow
Ebb and Flow control system for Hydroponics

Simple Arudio project to control Ebb-flow hydroponics

Arduino uno is used and is connected to a 2 relays, these relays control ac water pumps to pump water from a res to a plant level bucket. 

There are 4 inputs used as water level signals, 2 on bottom water level , 2 on top .. or for max water level i.e backup sensors
have not had a sensor though go bad or jam so 1 for top and bottom should be fine.

Development has stopped as I have a more complex setup using a raspi.
